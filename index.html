        Hi there! I'm Izzie, I'm from New Jersey, and I'm a Software Engineering major with an emphasis in Software Development, as well as an Illustration minor. I've been at BYU-I since 2022, though I have been taking courses here since 2020. I hope to graduate in 2026 with a Bachelor of Science as well as an Associate of Arts!

        In my free time, I enjoy drawing, cooking, gaming, and watching TV with my roommates. I frequent apps like Tumblr, Toyhou.se, Discord, etc., so I'm always in touch, no matter where I am! Thanks for visiting! :)
