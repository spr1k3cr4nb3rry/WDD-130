            <p>If you believe that there's something special and magical about the sound and experience of a classic Hammond organ, you're not alone.  Here at Trek II, we've been passionate for decades about maintaining and bringing out the best from these instruments.</p>
            <p>Trek II Products began years ago as a division of a service company that specialized in Hammond organs. Our early products were a direct response to our own day-to-day service needs.  In order to better focus on product development, Trek II became an independent company in 1993.  Over the years we've had the good fortune to employ a former regional service manager from the original Hammond Organ Company, a Hammond Master Technician, as well as an exceptional group of dedicated and highly talented designers, assemblers, and office staff.</p>
            <p>Today, Trek II designs and manufactures a wide array of quality parts for the repair, rebuilding, and upgrading of Hammond tonewheel organs and Leslie speakers.  In this role, it has been our privilege to play a part in the preservation and restoration of countless thousands of these remarkable instruments.</p>
            <p>Trek II is also a strong supporter of the Hammond technical community, having provided training to many Hammond technicians directly as well as through the Musical Instrument Technicians Association.</p>
            <p>Looking toward the future, we remain committed to providing our customers with the highest quality products and support in order to preserve the unique legacy and sound of the classic Hammond organ.</p>
