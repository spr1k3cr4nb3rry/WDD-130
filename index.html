            Hi there! As stated above, I am Izzie. 
            This is my second semester here at BYU-Idaho, and my fourth semester of college in general!
            I am a Software Engineering major (hence why I am in this class!) and an Illustration minor.
            When I graduate, I plan to go into interactive media design, which is a really fancy way of 
            saying I want to be able to create experiences for people using my knowledge of coding and the arts!
            In my career, I want to be able to connect with the user on a deeper level through specifically
            catered programs meant to elicit certain feelings! Think what an art piece does for a viewer, but 
            through the medium of a piece of software.

            I'm so happy to be able to meet you all, and I hope we have a great class this semester!
        </p>
